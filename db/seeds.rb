            genre: "Painting",
            year: "1805",
            description: "In the early 19th century, American artists joined their British counterparts and embarked on the Grand Tour. Washington Allston traveled to Europe upon his graduation from Harvard in 1800, and completed this large and ambitious work while in Rome in 1805. Loosely modeled on an alpine vista that Allston sketched while traveling from France to Italy, 'Diana on a Chase' is evocative of the classical landscapes of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. At right, the Roman goddess of the hunt and her companions wander through the vast mountainous scene.

            Publicly exhibited in Rome, 'Diana on a Chase' received glowing reviews and impressed Allston’s Romantically-minded contemporaries, including poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The artist’s pride in the work was short-lived, however: in 1839, Allston disavowed authorship of the painting, claiming that an aggressive cleaning had ruined his original conception.",

            year:  "1790-1800",
            description: "Though never elected to full membership in the Academy, Clodion was one of the most esteemed sculptors of the eighteenth century, and during his first residence in Rome he shared a studio with Jean-Antoine Houdon. Clodion worked frequently with terracotta, or baked clay, a material that was traditionally used by sculptors to explore ideas for larger projects in more expensive materials; it was highly prized by collectors around the middle of the eighteenth century for its sketchy, provisional qualities. Clodion responded to the growing market for terracotta sculpture by producing numerous small-scale works such as these. Toward the end of the century, he favored groups with inverted poses, such as these two figures carrying putti on opposite shoulders and turning in opposite directions, and he embraced the neoclassical style, basing the figures’ drapery and hairstyles on ancient models.",
